1. output = 20 (in printf y value is printing)
2. output = 30 (value at *ptr is 30 so it's printing the y value as 30)
3. output = (0,5,6)
  a. prints the value at ptr in 1st printf statement.
  b. prints the value at ptr (*ptr+5) i.e(0+5)=5.
  c. increment the value by 1 in printf(*ptr+1) i.e(5+1)=6.
4.
5. output = 0 2 (value at p is 2 and address of i is 0 so it prints i value as 0, address of j is 1 and value at j is 2 similar to *p so it prints j value as 2).
6. error (x is not declared).
7. output = 3 (value at array 2 is 3).
